# Mini jame game 14
This game was made during the Mini Jame Game 14 which is a game jam hosted on itch.io. The theme of the jam was "reversed" and the special object that needed to be implemented was a "flag".
# Reversible
Reversible is a game where you have to escape from a lab after having stolen a powerful gadget that can reverse the course of time to an object or a person !
You will have to pass multiple levels full of lasers, guards, buttons and way more mechanics !
In order for your gadget to work, you have to collect flags that are on the ground.
To revert an object or a person, just click on it and let the magic do its work !
# Installation
To play the game, you need to have Python 3.x already installed on your computer and pygame 2.x installed.
If you haven't downloaded python yet, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest stable version (when this game was created it was 3.10).

Once you installed python, to install pygame type :

```shell 
python -m pip install pygame
```

(Please note that instead of ```python``` the shell might be waiting for ```python3```, so if the first one doesn't work, try the second)
Then clone the repository in the folder of your choice and launch main.py:

```shell 
git clone https://github.com/MartinWho2/Mini-jame-game-14
```

```shell
cd Mini-jame-game-14
```

```shell
python main.py
```
